      "question": "When a circuit is open, _____________ cannot pass through it",
      "answer": "current",
      "explanation": "In an open circuit, the path is broken and electrons cannot flow, therefore no electric current can pass through it."

      "question": "The ratio of the potential difference to the current is known as ________",
      "answer": "resistance",
      "explanation": "According to Ohm's law, resistance (R) = potential difference (V) / current (I), or $R = \\frac{V}{I}$."
