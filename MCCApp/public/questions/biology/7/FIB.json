      "question": "The pairs of contrasting character (traits) of Mendel are called _________.",
      "answer": "alleles",
      "explanation": "Alleles are alternative forms of a gene that control the same trait but produce different phenotypes, as demonstrated in Mendel's contrasting traits experiments."

      "answer": "phenotype",
      "explanation": "Phenotype is the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism, resulting from the interaction between its genotype and the environment."
